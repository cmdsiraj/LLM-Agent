# Business Plan Draft: TerraPledge

## 1. The Problem

Many consumers want to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle, but face significant barriers. They are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of "eco-friendly" products, confused by misleading "greenwashing" claims, and lack the time to research and vet brands effectively. This leads to decision paralysis and inaction, particularly for those who are new to sustainable living and don't know where to begin or who to trust. The result is a gap between the desire to consume consciously and the ability to do so with confidence.

## 2. The Solution: TerraPledge

**TerraPledge** is a curated subscription box and educational service designed to guide newcomers on their journey to a sustainable lifestyle. We don't just ship products; we deliver trust, knowledge, and empowerment.

Our solution directly addresses the core problems:

*   **For "Newcomers to Sustainability":** We are the trusted first step. Our box is specifically curated to be a "Sustainable Starter Kit," providing essential, easy-to-adopt personal care swaps.
*   **Radical Transparency & Education:** Each box includes meticulously vetted, plastic-free, and cruelty-free products from innovative, often small-batch, artisans. More importantly, we include detailed educational content explaining:
    *   **Why Each Product Was Chosen:** Highlighting its specific environmental benefits (e.g., water saved, plastic eliminated).
    *   **How to Use It:** Simple guides to help users build new habits.
    *   **Our Curation Standards:** We will publish our strict, non-negotiable criteria for product selection (e.g., must be plastic-free, Leaping Bunny certified, etc.), building unparalleled trust.
*   **Convenience and Discovery:** We save our members time and effort by doing the intensive research for them, introducing them to high-quality, effective products they wouldn't easily find on their own.

## 3. Launch Cost Estimation

To launch TerraPledge and operate for the first three months (our initial runway), we need to account for one-time setup costs and recurring operational expenses. The following is a Python-calculated estimate based on launching with an initial target of 100 subscribers.

### Cost Calculation

```python
# --- Parameters ---
runway_months = 3
initial_subscribers = 100

# --- 1. One-Time Costs ---
# Costs to set up the business and brand that are paid once.
business_registration_legal = 500  # Fees for LLC registration and basic legal docs
website_dev_cost = 3000            # Cost for a professional e-commerce site setup (e.g., Shopify expert)
initial_branding_design = 1500     # Logo, brand guide, packaging design

total_one_time_costs = business_registration_legal + website_dev_cost + initial_branding_design

# --- 2. Recurring Costs (for 3-Month Runway) ---
# Costs that occur monthly, calculated for the entire runway period.

# Product & Fulfillment Costs
cost_per_box_sourcing = 25  # Wholesale cost of products + packaging for one box
initial_inventory_cost_per_month = cost_per_box_sourcing * initial_subscribers
total_product_inventory_cost = initial_inventory_cost_per_month * runway_months

# Marketing & Advertising Costs
monthly_marketing_spend = 1500  # Digital ads, influencer outreach to acquire first 100 subscribers
total_marketing_runway_cost = monthly_marketing_spend * runway_months

# Software & Platform Fees
monthly_software_fees = 150  # E.g., Shopify subscription, email marketing tool, etc.
total_software_runway_cost = monthly_software_fees * runway_months

# Sum of all recurring costs for the runway
total_recurring_runway_costs = total_product_inventory_cost + total_marketing_runway_cost + total_software_runway_cost

# --- 3. Grand Total Launch Cost ---
total_launch_cost = total_one_time_costs + total_recurring_runway_costs

# --- Print Results ---
